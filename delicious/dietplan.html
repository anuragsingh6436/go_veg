                            <p>Children from about one year old, will have been weaned onto solid foods, and can effectively eat the same foods as an adult, though obviously in different amounts. This stage in life is vital to good development both physically and mentally, therefore optimum nutrition is vital, not only for the child's health, but also reduction in risk of disease later in life. These few years are also times where the child experiments with a whole range of different foods and meals, and can shape eating patterns for their whole life. Try to steer your child away from processed foods and confectionary, and choose more traditional 'healthy' alternatives, though don't let them feel too left out from the other kids in the playgroup, and occasional treats are fine. </p>

                            <p>The following example meal plan has been designed for a 'typical' toddler from the age of around one to around five years old. It's been compiled to be nutritionally balanced to suit a child who's active and accounts for different likes and dislikes. Try to get your child to try different food choices, but remember if they really do not like a particular food, they need not have it; just praise them for trying it. Obviously all kids are different, so like all plans, it is merely an example and needs to be adapted to suit different circumstances. </p>

                            <p>Use this to give you an idea of what healthy nutritious foods are good to include, but don't forget get your child to drink plenty of fluid through the day. Try also to make foods fun and easy to eat; kids do often enjoy fruit, but won't eat it unless it's chopped up in a bowl for them to nibble on. </p>

                            <p>Following on from a toddler's diet, children from around age three or four through until adolescence are still developing both physically and mentally and the need for good nutrition continues. However this age is notorious for finicky diet habits, irregular eating and grazing; all behaviours which parents need to try to tempt their children out of. Kids are very active during these years and as they grow, nutritional requirements will increase and optimum nutrition is vital, not only for the child's health, but also for reduction in risk of disease later in life. During these years eating habits for life are still being shaped. Try to steer your child away from processed foods and confectionary, and choose more traditional 'healthy' alternatives, though don't let them feel too left out from the other kids at school, and occasional treats are fine. </p>

                            <p>The following example meal plan has been designed for 'typical' children from the age of around five years old to around eleven or twelve, though obviously nutritional requirements and portion sizes of meals will vary considerably between younger and older children in this age bracket. The plan below has been compiled to be nutritionally balanced to suit children who are active and accounts for different likes and dislikes. Preparing different foods for your child is very important, but remember if they really do not like a particular food, they need not have it. Obviously all kids are different, so like all the plans here, it is merely an example and needs to be adapted to suit different ages, sexes, activities and general circumstances. If your child is really into sports or other physical activities then they will needs lots of energy-packed foods throughout the day.</p>

                            <p>As your child grows up, they'll move on from following a child's diet, as they are now at an age when more and more food choice is down to them. This plan is therefore aimed both at parents of teenagers who have a responsibility to ensure their adolescent eats a good food, and at teenagers themselves – you may well be searching on the internet for good, healthy meal plans including food choices you like.</p>

                            <p>Adolescence is characterised from the age of 12 /13 to about 17/18, and in the latter years, the individual can really follow a suitable adult diet according to their needs (see other plans on this site).However the problem with adolescence is that although children are becoming less finicky, there is increasing emphasis to fend for yourself. Now you're older your parents may work late or leave you home alone for a few days; or you may be out more with friends so need to grab something to eat. The one thing I do urge teenagers to avoid, is junk take-away foods too often; these must really only be very occasional treats. </p>

                            <p>The following example meal plan has been designed for 'typical' adolescents. Portion sizes may need to be varied between sexes, as boys generally require more than girls, and if you're into sports or heavy physical activities, then you'll need to eat more. The plan below has been compiled to be nutritionally balanced to suit teenagers who are active and accounts for different likes and dislikes. </p>

A good calcium intake is especially important in teenage girls through to the age of about 30 years. Also remember to include sources of essential fats; high protein foods and slow released carb sources. </p>

                            <p>The following example meal plan has been designed for an 'average' male. It's nutritionally balanced to suit a young adult male who has a sedentary job and weighs 70-75kg, and he should maintain his weight on this. Obviously this is a hypothetical male, so like all plans, it is merely an example and needs to be adapted to suit an individual's own lifestyle, daily routine and nutritional requirements. Use this to give you an idea of what are healthy nutritious foods to include, but don't forget to vary your food choices and to drink plenty of water through the day.</p>
